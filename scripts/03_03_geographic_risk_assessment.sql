Purpose: Identify stable vs volatile markets for strategic location decisions

Key Business Questions Answered:
- Which countries/regions offer the most stable business environments?
- What geographic markets show highest workforce volatility?
- Where should companies establish operations to minimize layoff risk?
- How do regional patterns inform global expansion strategy?
