Industry Resilience Ranking â€” Layoff Impact Analysis
=============================================================
Script: 03_02_industry_resilience_ranking.sql
Purpose: 
	- Identify which industries weathered the crisis best/worst
	- Which industries show the strongest workforce stability?
	- What sectors recovered fastest from peak layoff periods?
	- Where should companies focus expansion or avoid risk?
	- How do industry layoff patterns inform investment strategy?
